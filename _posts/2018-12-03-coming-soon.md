I've been thinking about keeping a journal of sorts to write down all the good stuff I've been learning from sermons and content that I come across. I think it's about time that I start to write them down, and *hopefully* remember some from memory. At first I thought about writing them down in a physical journal, but I struggle already writing in my own **personal** journal. I have this issue where my mind races so fast that my writing can't keep up, or even my own typing can't keep up. It probably explains why I also stutter a lot and end up mumbling because I'm trying to spit out all these words out of my mouth.

Makes sense that I also went to a speech pathologist in my younger days, which I didn't realise until I started thinking about it later down the years.

My handwriting is horrible too, if you've seen it yourself, a lot of people comment that it *looks like a doctor writing a prescription*. It's gotten to the point where I try to read my own handwriting years later and I struggle to make out what I tried to write. 

So I suppose the only way I could do this is typing it out myself, which yeah true I would **lose** my sense of writing even more, and get so dependent on using a computer or my phone to write stuff down. It's bad enough already that I'm a software engineer so I spend 7 hours of my day already sitting infront of a computer jamming out. 

But it's a start, and I'm hoping its the start of something *good* in my life where I can learn about where I came from, where I am right now, and where I choose to go in the future. I think that's one of the **biggest** stigma of being born and raised in a religion, that I **didn't** have a choice because it was **forced** on me. 

It's probably true, but I choose to continue to practice to this day. And maybe one day, I can be able to justify myself with a **solid understanding** of what it means to be a Christian.

What are your thoughts? If you're like me and unsure on where to begin, maybe **we** can just pick a Book to pull apart, and see if we can put it all back together, **together**.
